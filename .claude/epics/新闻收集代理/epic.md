# Epic: 新闻收集代理

## Overview
The News Collection Agent is a critical data source component in the cryptocurrency multi-agent trading system. This agent will collect cryptocurrency-related news from the internet within the last 15 days, ensuring balanced collection of positive and negative news. The agent will use LLM services for intelligent content processing, news summarization, and sentiment analysis to provide timely and accurate news data for market sentiment analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Microservices Architecture**: Implement as a standalone agent with clear separation of concerns between news collection, processing, and analysis
- **Adapter Pattern**: Use news source adapters for flexible integration with multiple news APIs
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Implement asynchronous news processing with event queues for scalability
- **Database Selection**: Use PostgreSQL for structured news data storage with full-text search capabilities
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage existing LLM service module for content analysis and sentiment processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed news data and API responses

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Agent Status Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of news collection status and health metrics
- **Configuration Interface**: Web-based UI for managing news sources and collection parameters
- **Quality Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizations of news quality, sentiment balance, and coverage metrics
- **Alert Management Interface**: Configuration and monitoring of news alerts and notifications

### Backend Services
- **News Collection Service**: Scheduled service for fetching news from multiple sources
- **Content Processing Pipeline**: Multi-stage pipeline for news cleaning, deduplication, and analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis Service**: LLM-powered service for news sentiment classification and scoring
- **Data Storage Service**: Manages news data persistence with proper indexing and relationships
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API service for external system integration and data access
- **Monitoring Service**: Tracks performance metrics, error rates, and system health

### Infrastructure
- **Container Deployment**: Docker-based deployment with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Message Queue**: Redis Streams for processing pipeline coordination
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series news data
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics collection with Grafana dashboards
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Elasticsearch for log aggregation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up project structure and development environment
- Implement news source adapter framework
- Create basic news collection service
- Design and implement database schema

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 3-5)
